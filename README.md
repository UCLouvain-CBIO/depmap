# The `depmap` package

[**depmap**](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/depmap/) is an R data
package that loads 7 cancer dependency omics datasets, which are
loaded as .rmd files using data(). The .rmd files were generated by
using devtools::use_data function. The original .csv files for the
datasets can also be downloaded directly from the Broad Institute
website [depmap](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). As the DepMap
screening efforts continue, the
[**depmap**](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/depmap/) package will
updated on a quarterly basis, in line with the Broad Institute
[depmap](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) cancer dependency
mapping initiative.

## Introduction

The [depmap](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/depmap/) package aims to
provide a reproducible research framework to cancer dependency data
described by [Tsherniak, Aviad, et al. "Defining a cancer dependency
map." Cell 170.3 (2017):
564-576.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753430). The
[depmap](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/depmap/) package should allow a
researcher to easily mine dependency data taken from this cancer
genomic study, explore and mine the data.

To get an overview of the package, see the depmap vignette.

## Installation

To install [depmap](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/depmap/), the
[BiocManager](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/index.html)
Bioconductor Project Package Manager is required. If
[BiocManager](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/index.html)
is not already installed, it will need to be done so beforehand. Type
(within R) install.packages("BiocManager") (This needs to be done just
once.)

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("uclouvain-cbio/depmap")
```
