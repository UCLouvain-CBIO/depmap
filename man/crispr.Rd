\description{
The `crispr` dataset is the genetic dependency of CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout
of select genes in various cancer cell lines. This dataset includes data from
17634 genes, 558 cell lines, 26 primary diseases and 28 lineages. The columns
of `crispr` are: `depmap_id` a foreign key corresponding to the cancer cell
lineage, `cell_line` containing the common CCLE name of the cancer cell
lines, `gene` containing both the HUGO gene name of the knockout gene along
with entrez ID#, `gene_name` containing only the HUGO gene name, `entrez_id`
containing only the entrez ID# and `dependency` which contains the numerical
dependency score values for each pair of genes and cell lines.
}
\details{
This data represents the `gene_effect_corrected` file taken from
the 19Q1 [Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/)
cancer depenedency study. This dataset features the addition of a foreign key
`depmap_id` found in the first column of this dataset, which was added from
the `metadata` dataset. The numeric column `depenency` contains dependency
scores for a knock out of a known gene for a given cell line. The dataset has
been converted to a long format tibble. Variables names from the original
dataset were converted to lower case, put in snake case, and abbreviated
where feasible.
