\description{
The `drug_sensitivity` dataset contains the 19Q3 replicate collapsed logfold
change values relative to DMSO, corrected for experimental confounders using
ComBat. This dataset contains information refering to 4686 compounds, 578
cell lines, 23 primary diseases and 25 lineages. This dataset is part of the
SIGMA Repurposing release which contains small molecule viability datasets
generated using the Broad Repurposing Library and the PRISM multiplexed
cell-line viability assay. The columns of `drug_sensitivity` are: `depmap_id`
a foreign key corresponding to the cancer cell lineage, `cell_line` the
common CCLE name of the cancer cell lines, `compound` the synonym for the
drug compound, and `dependency` which contains the numerical dependency score
values for each pair of genes and cell lines.
}
\details{
This data originates from the 
`primary_replicate_collapsed_logfold_change.csv` file taken from the 19Q3
[Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) cancer depenedency
study. The derived dataset found in the `depmap` package features the
addition of a foreign key `depmap_id` found in the first column of this
dataset, which was added from the `metadata` dataset. This dataset has been
converted to a long format tibble. Variables names from the original dataset
were converted to lower case, put in snake case, and abbreviated where
feasible.
