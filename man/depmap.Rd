\title{depmap: Cancer Dependency Map Data Package}
\description{
The depmap package is a data package that accesses datsets from the Broad
Institute DepMap cancer dependency study using ExperimentHub. Datasets from
the most current release are available, including RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene
knockout screens quantifying the genetic dependency for select cancer cell
lines. Additional datasets are also available pertaining to the log copy
number of genes for select cell lines, protein expression of cell lines as
measured by reverse phase protein lysate microarray (RPPA), 'Transcript Per
Million' (TPM) data, chemical dependecy (drug_sensativity) as well as
supplementary datasets which contain metadata and mutation calls for the
other datasets found in the current release. This package will be updated on
a quarterly basis to incorporate the latest Broad Institute DepMap Public
cancer dependency datasets. All data made available in this package was
generated by the Broad Institute DepMap for research purposes and not
intended for clinical use. This data is distributed under the Creative
