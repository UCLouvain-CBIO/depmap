\description{
The `TPM` dataset contains the CCLE "Transcript Per Million" RNAseq gene
expression data for protein coding genes. This dataset includes data from
57820 genes, 1165 cancer cell lines, 33 primary diseases, 32 lineages. The
columns of `TPM` are: `depmap_id`, a foreign key corresponding to the cancer
cell lineage, `cell_line` the common CCLE name of the cancer cell lines,
`gene` containing both the HUGO gene name of the knockdown gene along with
ensembl ID#, `gene_name` containing the HUGO gene name and `ensembl_id`
containing only the ensembl ID# and `expression` which contains the numerical
protein coding gene expression change at scale (log2(TPM+1)).
}
\details{
This data originates from the `CCLE_depMap_19Q1_TPM` file taken
from the 19Q1 [Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) cancer
depenedency study. This dataset features the addition of a foreign key
`depmap_id` found in the first column of this dataset, which was added from
the `metadata` dataset. This dataset has been converted to a long format
tibble. Variables names from the original dataset were converted to lower
case, put in snake case, and abbreviated where feasible.
