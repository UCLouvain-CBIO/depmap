\description{
The `RPPA` dataset contains Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) Western Blot
expression data. This dataset includes data from 214 genes, 899 cancer cell
lines, 28 primary diseases, 28 lineages. The columns of `RPPA` are:
`depmap_id`, a foreign key corresponding to the cancer cell lineage,
`cell_line` which contains the common CCLE name of the cancer cell lines,
`gene` which contains the knockdown gene expression, `antibody` containing
the name of knocked down gene and `expression` containing numerical protein
expression data.
}
\details{
This data represents the `CCLE_RPPA_20180123` file taken from the
19Q1 [Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) cancer
depenedency study. This dataset features the addition of a foreign key
`depmap_id` found in the first column of this dataset, which was added from
the `metadata` dataset. This dataset has been converted to a long format
tibble. Variables names from the original dataset were converted to lower
case, put in snake case, and abbreviated where feasible.
