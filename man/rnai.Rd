\description{
The `rnai` dataset contains the 19Q3 cancer dependency of select cancer cell
lines for genes found by RNAi gene knockdown. This dataset includes data from
17309 genes, 712 cancer cell lines, 31 primary diseases and 31 lineages.
The columns of `rnai` are: `depmap_id`, a foreign key corresponding to the
cancer cell lineage, `cell_line` containing the common CCLE name of the
cancer cell lines, `gene` containing both the HUGO gene name of the knockdown
gene along with entrez ID#, `gene_name` which only contains HUGO gene name,
`entrez_id` which contains only the entrez ID# and `dependency` which
contains the numerical dependency score values for each pair of genes and
cell lines. This dataset can be loaded into the R environment with the
`depmap_rnai` function.
}
\details{
This data represents the `D2_combined_genetic_dependency_scores`
file taken from the 19Q3 [Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/)
cancer depenedency study. The derived dataset found in the `depmap` package
features the addition of a foreign key `depmap_id` found in the first column
of this dataset, which was added from the `metadata` dataset. This dataset
has been converted to a long format tibble. Variables names from the original
dataset were converted to lower case, put in snake case, and abbreviated
where feasible.
