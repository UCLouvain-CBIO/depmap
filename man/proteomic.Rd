\description{
The `proteomic` dataset contains the 20Q2 quantitative profiling of proteins
via mass spectrometry from the Gygi lab. This dataset contains 12399 proteins
tested in 375 cell lines, including 24 primary diseases and 27 lineages. The
columns of this dataset are: `depmap_id`, a foreign key corresponding to the
cancer cell lineage, `cell_line` the common CCLE name of the cancer cell
lines, `gene_name` containing the HUGO gene name and `entrez_id` containing
only the entrez ID# and `protein_expression` which contains the normalized
protein expression for cancer cell lines. This dataset can be loaded into R
environment with the `depmap_proteomic` function.
}
\details{
This data originates from the `protein_quant_current_normalized.csv`
file taken from the 20Q2 [Broad Institute](https://depmap.org/portal/download/)
cancer depenedency study. The derived dataset found in the `depmap` package
features the addition of a foreign key `depmap_id` found in the first column
of this dataset, which was added from the `metadata` dataset. This dataset
has been converted to a long format tibble. Variables names from the original
dataset were converted to lower case, put in snake case, and abbreviated
where feasible.
