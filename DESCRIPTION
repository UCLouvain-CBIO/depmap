Description: The depmap package is a data package that accesses datsets from the
    Broad Institute DepMap cancer dependency study using ExperimentHub. Datasets
    from the most current release are available, including RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9
    gene knockout screens quantifying the genetic dependency for select cancer
    cell lines. Additional datasets are also available pertaining to the log
    copy number of genes for select cell lines, protein expression of cell lines
    as measured by reverse phase protein lysate microarray (RPPA), 'Transcript
    Per Million' (TPM) data, as well as supplementary datasets which contain
    metadata and mutation calls for the other datasets found in the current
    release. This package will be updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate
    the latest Broad Institute DepMap Public cancer dependency datasets. All
    data made available in this package was generated by the Broad Institute
    DepMap for research purposes and not intended for clinical use. This data is
    distributed under the Creative Commons license (Attribution 4.0
    International (CC BY 4.0)).
