Description: The depmap package is a data package that contains
    datsets from the Broad Institute DepMap cancer dependency study.
    Seven datsets are provided: `rnai`, `crispr`, `copyNumber`, `TPM`,
    `RPPA`, `mutationCalls` and `metadata`. The `rnai` and `crispr`
    datasets each respectively contain RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene
    knockdown and knockout screens of human genes relating to the
    genetic dependency for select cancer cell lines. Additional datasets
    relating to the log copy number of select genes (`copyNumber`), as
    well as proteinexpression measured by reverse phase protein lysate
    microarray (`RPPA`) and 'Transcript Per Million' (`TPM`) are also
    provided. The last two datasets `metadata` and `mutationCalls`
    contain metadata for the other datasets found in the DepMap Public
    19Q1 release. The depmap R package will be updated on a quarterly
    basis to incorporate the latest release of the Broad Institute
    DepMap cancer dependency datasets.
