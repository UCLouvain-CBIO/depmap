Description: The depmap package is a data package that contains
    datsets from the Broad Institute DepMap. Seven datsets are made
    provided: `rnai`, `crispr`, `copyNumber`, `TPM`, `RPPA`,
    `mutationCalls` and `metadata`. The `rnai` and `crispr` datasets
    each respectively contain RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout
    screens of human genes relating to the genetic dependency for
    select cancer cell lines.  Additional datasets relating to the log
    copy number of select genes (`copyNumber`), as well as protein
    expression measured by reverse phase protein lysate microarray
    (`RPPA`) and 'Transcript Per Million' (`TPM`) are also
    provided. The last two datasets `metadata` and `mutationCalls`
    contain metadata for the other datasets found in the DepMap Public
    19Q1 release. The depmap R package will be updated on a quarterly
    basis to incorporate the latest release of the Broad Institute
    DepMap Public cancer dependency datasets.
